Description

A Simple News App using NewsAPI.org API/JSON Data
This is a simple news app that uses an API to retrieve json metadata and populates the page with the first 3 news stories from the selected news source/blog. Currently there are only three sources listed however NewsAPI.org provides up to 70 news sources which can be easliy added for more news options.
Depending on the news provider, some feeds can be set to sort stories by: top, latest, and popular. The IGN feed has been set to top news, while the first 3 sources are set to provide the latest news feed.
